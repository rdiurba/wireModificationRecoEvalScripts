The repository is a centralized place for the scripts used to generate ratios of raw data and simulation distributions of hit information from anode-cathode crossing muons in MicroBooNE. 

The paper outlying the full method on how these plots are used for detector-related LArTPC uncertainties are here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10270-8

The scripts are created by Joseph Zennamo, Lauren Yates, Maya Wospakrik, Arturo Fiorentini, and Richard Diurba.
